# It's official! 

I have been offered and accepted an Associate Professor position at my alma mater, [CityU of Seattle][1].

I am very excited to be joining the dynamic and engaging faculty of the *School of Technology & Computing*. 

For my first semester, I will be teaching CS 467 Systems Security. This is a course focused on the security aspects of computing systems and will include lab work at [TryHackMe.com][2].

Students completing this course will have an understanding of the holistic approach to security including policy, authentication, access control, monitoring, recovery, testing, and documentation.

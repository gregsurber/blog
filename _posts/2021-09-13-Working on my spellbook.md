# Working on my spellbook

So, I have decided to document the most-used tools I encounter on my path to learning more about penetration testing. I created a repository for my write-ups, which I have called my [Spellbook][1] because, let's face it, I am a big ol' nerd!

My plan is to create a single-page writeup of the most common tools I encounter, documenting the basic usage for each, both the how's and the when's I expect them to be of use. I'll include links to official repositories and write-ups, when I have them, so I can do deeper research when needed.

For now this repository will remain private. Once I have accumulated enough write-ups that I think it might be useful to others, I will consider making it available.
